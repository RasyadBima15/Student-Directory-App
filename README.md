# Student-Directory-App

The Student Directory App is a Java application designed to manage student data using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL for the database. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators or teachers to perform various operations related to student management.

The application consists of two branches besides the main branch:

1. **Project_1** (First Version without using GUI): This branch represents the initial version of the app, which focuses on the core functionality without a graphical interface. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for performing operations such as adding, updating, and deleting student records directly through MySQL commands.

2. **Project_2** (Second Version using GUI): This branch represents an enhanced version of the app with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Java Swing. The GUI offers a more intuitive and interactive way to manage student data. Users can perform operations such as adding, updating, and deleting student records through a user-friendly interface.
